# 🖥️ Slackware Retro Utils

Small collection of handy scripts for Slackware Linux.  
Created with full binary paths (`/usr/bin/...`) for maximum compatibility.  

## 🚀 Included scripts

- `sysinfo.sh` – quick system overview (kernel, uptime, memory, disk usage)
- `backup_home.sh` – backup your home directory into `/backup/`
- `update_slackpkg.sh` – update packages via slackpkg
- `mount_usb.sh` – mount USB drive into `/mnt/usb`
- `netcheck.sh` – check if the internet connection is alive

## ⚡ Usage

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
./sysinfo.sh
```

Each script uses **absolute binary paths** for Slackware style purity.
